## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- macOS (tested on latest versions)
- Command Line Tools for Xcode
- Internet connection

### Installation

**⚠️ Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don't want or need. Don't blindly use my settings unless you know what they do. Use at your own risk!

#### Step 1: Clone and Pre-install

Run this command in your terminal to download and prepare the dotfiles:

```bash
sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snics/dotfiles/master/pre-install.sh`"
```

#### Step 2: Run Installation Wizard

To run the install wizard, execute:

```bash
sh ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```

The wizard will guide you through the installation process and let you choose which components to install.

## 📁 Project Structure

This dotfiles repository uses the following structure:

```
~/.dotfiles/
├── _install/          # Installation scripts for individual tools
├── asdf/              # asdf version manager configuration
├── brew/              # Homebrew bundle file
├── docs/              # Documentation and screenshots
├── ghostty/           # Ghostty terminal configuration

├── install.sh         # Main installation script
└── pre-install.sh     # Pre-installation setup
```

### My Development Folder Structure

I use a well-organized folder structure for all development work. The installation wizard can optionally create this structure for you:

```bash
~/Projects/           # Root folder for all development
├── GitHub/           # GitHub repositories
├── GitLab/           # GitLab repositories
├── Scripts/          # Automation scripts and utilities

├── Startups/         # Startup projects (optional)
├── Non-Profit/       # Non-profit organization projects (optional)
├── Talks/            # Presentations and talk materials (optional)
├── Workshop/         # Workshop materials and projects (optional)
└── Throwaway/        # Temporary projects and experiments
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Details

### Neovim Setup

![terminal.gif](docs/terminal.gif)

Neovim should work out of the box once the correct plugins are installed. To install the plugins, open Neovim with:

```bash
nvim +PlugInstall
```

![NeoVim.png](docs/NeoVim.png)

### Setup ~/.secrets

For sensitive information like API keys and tokens, create a `~/.secrets` file. An example template is provided:

```bash
cp -f ~/.dotfiles/.secrets.example ~/.secrets
```

Edit the file and add your secrets:

```bash
vim ~/.secrets
```

The `.secrets` file is sourced by ZSH and should contain bash-compatible environment variable exports.

### Customizing the Setup

Each configuration directory contains settings for its respective tool. Feel free to customize:

- **ZSH**: Edit files in `zsh/settings/`
- **Git**: Modify `git/catppuccin.gitconfig`
- **tmux**: Adjust `tmux/.config/tmux/tmux.conf`
- **Ghostty**: Configure `ghostty/` settings

## 🔄 Updates & Maintenance

Updating your installed applications and tools is simple! I've created a convenient alias that updates everything at once:

```bash
update
```

This command will:
- Update Homebrew and all installed packages
- Update ZSH plugins
- Update asdf plugins and tool versions
- Perform system maintenance tasks

You can find the implementation in `zsh/settings/functions/update.zsh`.

## 📝 Planning & Roadmap

I maintain a structured planning system for future improvements and features. Check out the [`planning/`](planning/) directory for:

- **Roadmap**: High-level plans and timeline
- **Backlog**: Ideas and future enhancements
- **In Progress**: Currently working on features

Feel free to suggest new features or improvements by opening an issue!

### What's Next

Some planned improvements include:
- Further automation of the installation process
- Additional tool integrations
- Enhanced documentation
- More themes and customization options

See the full roadmap in [`planning/roadmap.md`](planning/roadmap.md) for details.
